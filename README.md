Question 1
Create an MVP for an event management review and rating app. The implementation will have both frontend and API with the following requirements:

A user must register and login to be able to leave review or access
Users should be able to login after successful registration
Users should be able to view their record on the dashboard
The app should have a secure login security implementation
Users should be able to view community news section without login into the system
The app should handle error properly and prevent data leakages
The app should have a note feature. The note should be able to store draft content that is editable anytime before it is saved.
Administrators should be able to view review and ratings of all the users.
The API should be either REST or GraphQL
Users should be able to forget password during password reset
Notes
Frontend - ReactJS | ReactNative (Tpypescript)
Backend - Use NodeJS
Apply your preferred coding practice and style
Unit test is an added advantage
Add README
Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture
Writing design documents will attract extra points : -->

<!-- To run the code after clone
-must have PostGreSQL database

npm install
frontend:
npm run dev
backend:
npm start  -->
